# Schedule

The schedule will follow the Princeton SICSS Team virtual Summer Institute for the first week. The second week will be a series of speakers from academia and the private sector hosted by the University of Bologna. Students will be exposed to a wide variety of applications of Computational Methods and have the chance to interact with the speakers through Q&A and activities. 

A full schedule will be posted once all speakers have confirmed their participation. Please see the People page for a complete list of confirmed speakers (with more to come!).
